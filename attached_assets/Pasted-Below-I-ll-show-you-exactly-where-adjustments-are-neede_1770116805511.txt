Below I’ll show you exactly where adjustments are needed, why, and what to change (copy-ready). Think of this as taking it from 8.5/10 → 10/10 mall pitch.

1. Branding & consistency fixes (small but important)
❌ Issue

You alternate between:

“Mr. Bubbles Bubbles”

“Mr. Bubbles”

✅ Fix (pick ONE and use it everywhere)

Recommended:

Mr. Bubbles – Premium Car Wash Experience

Why malls care: consistency = professionalism.

2. The rewards ladder is missing the BIG GOAL (psychology issue)
❌ Issue

Your ladder currently stops at 800 points in the written section, but later you mention 1,500 points in the financials.

That’s a red flag for reviewers.

✅ Fix: Explicitly add Tier 3 in the Rewards Ladder section

Replace Section 2 with this (copy-paste):

2. Rewards Ladder

Key Principle: Upgrade-heavy rewards, not cash-off heavy.
Upgrades feel valuable to customers while protecting margins.

Tier 1 – Frequent Wins (250–400 points)
• Free tyre shine
• Free air freshener
• Interior wipe-down

Tier 2 – Milestone Rewards (800 points)
• R30 off any wash OR
• Free premium add-on

Tier 3 – Headline Reward (1,500 points)
• Free Basic Wash (up to R80)
• May be combined with a paid upgrade to enhance value

Why this matters:
Malls want to see a clear long-term retention hook.

3. Add ONE sentence that protects you from “discount abuse”
❌ Issue

Mall managers will silently ask:

“What if everyone redeems at once?”

✅ Fix: Add this sentence in Section 5 – Program Controls

Add bullet:

• Redemptions are subject to daily capacity and operational availability

This gives you legal and operational cover without scaring anyone.

4. Financial section needs one clarifying line (very important)
❌ Issue

You show gross margin ranges, but you don’t explicitly say:

discounts do NOT push you below variable cost.

✅ Fix: Add this line at the end of Section 3

Add:

All rewards and discounts are structured to ensure that variable operating costs are covered on every redeemed transaction.

This sentence instantly reassures finance-focused reviewers.

5. Funding model: make tenant contribution feel optional, not forced
❌ Issue

“R10 per redemption” can feel like a fee if not framed correctly.

✅ Fix: Reword slightly (softens resistance)

Replace “Tenant Contribution” paragraph with:

Tenant Contribution (Optional, Performance-Based)
Participating tenants may contribute a small marketing fee (e.g. R10 per redemption) only when a reward is redeemed. This contribution supports shared promotion and ensures the program remains sustainable.

Why this works:

Removes fear

Still keeps your cost-sharing model intact

6. Program controls: clean up symbols & formatting
❌ Issue

The ' symbols look like a formatting error and reduce polish.

✅ Fix

Replace them with standard bullets or checkmarks consistently:

✔ Redemption limits
✔ Booking benefits
✔ Fraud prevention
✔ Point expiry
✔ Participation rules

Malls notice presentation.

7. Add ONE mall-facing sentence that reframes your role
❌ Issue

You imply value, but don’t state your positioning clearly.

✅ Fix: Add this line under “The Big Idea”

This initiative positions the car wash as a customer experience amenity rather than a standalone retail tenant.

This is gold for mall leasing teams.

8. Pilot section: add a success metric (makes it “measurable”)
❌ Issue

You describe the pilot, but not how success is judged.

✅ Fix: Add this at the end of Section 8

Pilot Success Indicators:
• Increase in repeat car wash visits
• Measured reward redemptions
• Tenant participation feedback
• Customer engagement metrics

Malls LOVE measurable pilots.

9. Final polish: tighten the closing CTA
❌ Issue

The closing is good, but passive.

✅ Fix: Replace “Ready to Partner?” section with:

Next Steps
We propose a 30-day pilot with selected tenants to validate customer uptake and operational flow.

We welcome the opportunity to present this proposal in person and align it with Boksburg Centre’s customer experience strategy.

Professional. Confident. Non-pushy.

Final verdict (honest)

You do not need to change the core idea or maths.
You needed:

1 missing reward tier

2 margin-protection sentences

3 mall-language tweaks

formatting cleanup

After these changes, this proposal is:
✅ Mall-friendly
✅ Finance-safe
✅ Customer-exciting
✅ Scalable
