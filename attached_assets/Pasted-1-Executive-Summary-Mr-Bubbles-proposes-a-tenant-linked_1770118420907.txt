1. Executive Summary

Mr. Bubbles proposes a tenant-linked loyalty rewards program whereby customers earn points when they spend at participating restaurants, retail stores, and service outlets within Boksburg Centre. These points are redeemable for car wash rewards at Mr. Bubbles.

The initiative positions the car wash as a customer experience amenity, rather than a standalone retail tenant, creating a measurable retention tool that increases average basket size, dwell time, and repeat visits across the centre.

2. The Big Idea

This is not a discount scheme.
It is a structured, measurable loyalty system designed to positively influence customer behaviour.

The program is designed to:

Increase average basket size (“spend slightly more to unlock rewards”)

Increase dwell time (“wash while shopping or dining”)

Increase repeat centre visits through progressive rewards

Value Delivered

For the Centre

Increased overall tenant spend

Strong differentiation versus competing centres

Actionable customer and behavioural analytics

For Tenants

Additional marketing exposure

Performance-based participation

Rewards focused on repeat customers

3. How the Program Works
Customer Journey

Customer spends at participating centre tenants

Customer earns loyalty points based on defined spend bands

Points accumulate in a digital wallet (QR-based or card-based)

Points are redeemed for car wash rewards at Mr. Bubbles

Customer returns to the centre to earn additional points, creating a repeat-visit loop

4. Spend-Band Earning System

Points are earned in spend bands to ensure fairness, sustainability, and long-term viability.
This approach encourages repeat centre visits rather than rewarding once-off high-value transactions.

Mall Spend	Points Earned
R100 – R199	10 points
R200 – R299	20 points
R300 – R399	30 points
R400 – R499	40 points
Every additional R100	+10 points

In simple terms:
Customers earn 10 points for every R100 spent at participating tenants.

5. Rewards Ladder

Upgrade-Focused, Profit-Safe Reward Structure

Tier	Points	Reward
Tier 1 – Engagement	50 pts	Free air freshener or tyre shine
Tier 2 – Momentum	120 pts	Free interior wipe-down or premium add-on
Tier 3 – Milestone	250 pts	R30 off any wash
Tier 4 – Headline	500 pts	Free Basic Wash (up to R80)

Rewards are designed to offer high perceived customer value while protecting operating margins.

6. Financial Sustainability & Margin Protection
Key Assumptions

Average customer spend per centre visit: R300

Points earned per visit: 30 points

Visits required to reach headline reward (500 points): ±17 visits

Cost Impact

Variable cost of a basic wash: ±R45

Reward cost is distributed across ±17 influenced visits

Outcome:
Strong customer retention with healthy unit economics.

All rewards are structured to ensure that variable operating costs are covered on every redemption, with controlled exposure and capped liability.

7. Funding Model
Split-Cost Structure (Sustainable & Low Risk)

Tenant Contribution (Optional & Performance-Based)
Participating tenants may contribute a small marketing fee (e.g. R10 per redemption), payable only when a reward is redeemed. This supports shared promotion and long-term sustainability.

Mr. Bubbles Contribution

Low-cost service upgrades (±R3–R12 cost)

Limited cash-off rewards

Daily redemption caps

Centre Benefit

Increased spend and dwell time

Customer loyalty data

Unique experiential differentiator

8. Program Controls & Risk Management

The following safeguards ensure operational stability and minimal centre impact:

Maximum one reward redemption per vehicle per day

Maximum R30 discount per transaction (excluding headline reward)

Points earned via QR scan linked to receipt reference

Redemptions subject to daily capacity and operational availability

Points expire after 90 days, limiting long-term liability

Participation is opt-in, starting with 5–10 tenants during pilot

The program will be managed to ensure no disruption to parking flow, pedestrian movement, or overall centre operations

9. Tenant Benefits (Supporting Overall Centre Performance)

Participating tenants receive:

Counter QR stand: “Earn points for car wash rewards”

Simple cashier guidance

Listing on the Mr. Bubbles website and booking platform

Monthly performance summary (earnings and redemptions)

This structure supports tenant performance while reinforcing overall centre loyalty.
