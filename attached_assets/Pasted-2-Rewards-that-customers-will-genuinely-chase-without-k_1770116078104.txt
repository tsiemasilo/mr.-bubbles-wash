2) Rewards that customers will genuinely chase (without killing your margin)
Key principle:

Your rewards should be upgrade-heavy, not “cash-off heavy.”
Upgrades feel valuable to customers, but cost you far less than giving away big discounts.

Recommended reward ladder (mid/long-term)

This is designed so customers look forward to the next milestone.

Tier 1: Frequent small wins (keeps them engaged)

250 points: Free tyre shine OR air freshener (low cost to you)

400 points: Free interior wipe-down add-on

Tier 2: “I’m getting close!” milestones (drives repeat)

800 points: R30 off any wash OR free premium add-on

Tier 3: The big reward (the goal customers chase)

1,500 points: Free Basic Wash (or “free wash up to R80”)
(This is the headline reward customers tell others about.)

Tier 4 (optional): Premium retention

3,000 points: Free Wash + Vacuum (or a “Deluxe upgrade”)

Point expiry (important):

Points expire after 90 days (keeps the cycle moving and limits liability)

3) Real-world maths (designed to protect your profits)

Let’s use realistic assumptions for Boksburg / East Rand mall traffic:

Your pricing (example)

Basic wash price: R80

Wash + vacuum: R140

Average ticket (blended): R140 (because many add vacuum/tyre shine)

Your variable costs per car (typical hand wash)

(These are approximate but realistic ranges)

Chemicals + consumables: R10–R18

Water/electricity per car: R4–R8

Labour per car (depends on throughput): R20–R35
Estimated variable cost per car: R34–R61

So on a R140 average ticket:

Gross margin before rent/admin could be roughly R79–R106 (depends on your operation)

Now the rewards cost (what it really costs you)
Upgrades (best for margin)

Tyre shine / air freshener: cost to you ± R3–R8

Interior wipe-down: ± R5–R12

Controlled “cash-off”

When you give R30 off, you’re not giving away R30 profit — you’re giving away revenue.
If your variable cost is still covered, you’re typically sacrificing part of your margin, not the whole ticket.

The “Free Basic Wash” risk (and how we control it)

A free wash sounds expensive—unless it’s earned slowly and capped properly.

At 1 point per R1 spent:

Customer needs R1,500 spend in the mall to earn a free basic wash.

That spend happens across tenants — which is exactly what the mall wants.

Your “cost” of that reward:

You’re giving away an R80 wash, but your real out-of-pocket is the variable cost (say ±R45 average).

You can also structure it as “Free Basic Wash with any paid upgrade/add-on” (like R20 vacuum add-on or tyre shine), which offsets cost and increases average basket.

✅ This makes the headline reward attractive but financially safe.

4) The funding model (so discounts don’t come out of your pocket)

To avoid your profits being “the sponsor,” you pitch shared funding:

Recommended structure: “Split the reward cost”
Tenant contribution (marketing fee)

Participating tenants contribute a small amount when a reward is redeemed, e.g.:

R10 per redemption (only when a customer redeems a reward)
This is tiny compared to what they spend on marketing, and it’s performance-based.

Your contribution

You contribute the remainder through:

low-cost upgrades

limited R-off

caps per day

Mall benefit

More spending

Differentiation

Foot traffic retention
You can ask the mall to support with signage space / marketing placements.

This model makes the program sustainable long-term.

5) Controls that keep the program profitable (non-negotiable)

These are the guardrails that make malls comfortable and protect you:

Redemption limits

Max 1 reward redemption per vehicle per day

Max R30 discount per transaction (unless it’s the 1,500-point “free wash” reward)

Booking benefits (pushes scheduling + reduces chaos)

Booked customers can redeem plus get a priority slot
(Improves flow and reduces idle time)

Fraud prevention

Points earned only from:

QR scan linked to till receipt number, OR

cashier entry with receipt reference

High-value redemptions may require showing the receipt (optional)

Expiry

Points expire after 90 days (reduces long-term liability)

Participation

Tenants are opt-in and can be “selected stores only”

You can start with 5–10 tenants as a pilot

6) Why tenants will promote it (make it easy for them)

You give each participating tenant:

a counter QR stand (“Earn points for car wash rewards”)

a short script for cashiers

inclusion on your website / booking page (“Participating stores”)

monthly report: how many customers earned/redeemed via them

Tenants love programs that are:

simple

performance-based

measurable

7) Reporting & accountability (what malls want to see)

Monthly reporting includes:

number of participating tenants

points issued vs points redeemed

redemptions by tenant category (restaurants vs retail)

peak redemption times

estimated incremental mall spend influenced (proxy metric)

customer repeat rate (re-booking rate)

This turns your program into a mall analytics asset, not just a car wash promo.

8) Pilot roll-out (makes it easy to approve)
Phase 1 — 30-day pilot

5–10 tenants

1 bay operation

reward ladder active

signage in 2–3 key areas

weekly check-ins with mall management

Phase 2 — Scale to 3 months

add more tenants

add membership option (optional)

adjust reward ladder based on redemption rates
