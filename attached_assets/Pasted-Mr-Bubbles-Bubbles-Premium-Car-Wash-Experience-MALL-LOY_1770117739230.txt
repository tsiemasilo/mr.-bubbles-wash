Next Steps

1. Executive Summary

Mr. Bubbles proposes a tenant-linked rewards program where customers earn loyalty points when they spend at participating mall restaurants, retail stores, and service outlets. These points are redeemable for car wash rewards at Mr. Bubbles.

This initiative positions the car wash as a customer experience amenity, rather than a standalone retail tenant, creating a measurable retention tool that increases average basket size, dwell time, and repeat visits across the mall.

2. The Big Idea

This is not a discount scheme.
It is a structured, measurable loyalty system designed to influence customer behaviour.

The program:

Increases average basket size (“spend a little more to unlock rewards”)

Increases dwell time (“wash while you shop or dine”)

Increases repeat visits through progressive rewards

Value Delivered:

For the Mall

Increased overall spend

Strong differentiation from competing centres

Actionable customer analytics

For Tenants

Free marketing exposure

Performance-based participation

Rewards that target repeat customers

3. How It Works
Customer Journey

Customer spends at participating mall tenants (restaurants, retail, services)

Customer earns loyalty points based on spend bands

Points accumulate in a digital wallet (QR / card-based system)

Points are redeemed for car wash rewards at Mr. Bubbles

Customer returns to the mall to earn more points, creating a repeat-visit loop

4. Spend Bands Earning System

Points are earned in spend bands to ensure fairness, sustainability, and long-term viability.
This structure encourages repeat mall visits rather than rewarding once-off high-value transactions.

Mall Spend	Points Earned
R100 – R199	10 points
R200 – R299	20 points
R300 – R399	30 points
R400 – R499	40 points
Every additional R100	+10 points

In simple terms:
Customers earn 10 points for every R100 spent at participating tenants.

5. Rewards Ladder

Profit-Safe, Upgrade-Heavy Reward Structure

Tier	Points	Reward
Tier 1 – Engagement	50 pts	Free air freshener or tyre shine
Tier 2 – Momentum	120 pts	Free interior wipe-down or premium add-on
Tier 3 – Milestone	250 pts	R30 off any wash
Tier 4 – Headline	500 pts	Free Basic Wash (up to R80)

Rewards are structured to deliver high perceived value while protecting operating margins.

6. Financial Analysis
Real-World Maths (Margin Protection)

Key Assumptions

Average mall spend per visit: R300

Points earned per visit: 30 points

Visits to reach headline reward (500 pts): ±17 visits

Cost Impact

Variable cost of a basic wash: ± R45

Cost is spread across ±17 influenced visits

Result: strong retention with healthy unit economics

All rewards are structured so that variable operating costs are covered on every redemption.

7. Funding Model
Split-Cost Structure (Sustainable Long-Term)

Tenant Contribution (Optional & Performance-Based)
Participating tenants may contribute a small marketing fee (e.g. R10 per redemption), payable only when a reward is redeemed. This supports shared promotion and program sustainability.

Mr. Bubbles Contribution

Low-cost upgrades (tyre shine, air freshener; ±R3–R12 cost)

Limited cash-off rewards

Daily redemption caps

Mall Benefit

Increased spend and dwell time

Customer loyalty data

Unique experiential differentiator

8. Program Controls (Non-Negotiable Safeguards)

Maximum 1 reward redemption per vehicle per day

Maximum R30 discount per transaction (excluding headline reward)

Points earned via QR scan linked to receipt reference

Redemptions subject to daily capacity and operational availability

Points expire after 90 days to limit liability

Participation is opt-in, starting with 5–10 tenants during pilot
